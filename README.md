# LeagueStats

A React app that uses Riot Games' API to retrieve and display players' match history and profile details in League of Legends.

## Installation

**1.** Use **`git clone`** or download this repository.

**2.** Run **`npm install`**.

**3.** Go to [Riot Developer Portal](https://developer.riotgames.com) and get a temporary API key.

**4.** Go into the **`.env`** file in the `leagueserver` folder and replace `API_KEY` with the key you got from riot.

**5.** Run **`npm start`** in `leagueserver` and `leagueproj` folders.

## Demo
You can see a working version of the app [here](https://league-stats.netlify.app/) (NOTE: By default it uses my profile in case some people don't have one; Also, it might take up to ~20 seconds to load the backend)
